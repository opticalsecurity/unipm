**unipm** is an open-source CLI to manage dependencies in Node.js projects,  
automatically using the right package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, etc.)  
based on your project. Stop worrying about which command to use in each repo:  
unipm detects and runs it for you!

---

## Installation

```bash
bun install -g unipm
# or
npm install -g unipm
```

---

## Basic usage

```bash
# Install a dependency
unipm add react
# or shortcut
unipm i react

# Uninstall a dependency
unipm remove react
# or shortcut
unipm r react

# Install all project dependencies
unipm install
# or shortcut
unipm i

# Update dependencies
unipm update
# or shortcut
unipm u
```

unipm automatically detects the package manager by lockfiles and/or package.json "packageManager" value.  
(`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`).
