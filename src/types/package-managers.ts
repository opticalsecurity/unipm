/*
  Main enum and types for package managers
  - PackageManager: Enum for package managers
  - PackageManagers: Array of package managers

  PackageManager lets you identify any package manager compatible and make sure every TypeScript file
  knows what you are talking about. For example, instead of returning "npm" as a string, you can return PackageManager.NPM, which is a type-safe way to handle package managers.
